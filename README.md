### Abstract 

Large amount of time is spent by software developers in investigating bug reports. It is useful to indicate when a bug report will be closed, since it would help software teams to prioritise their work. Thus, in this work we develop a technique
to predict the bug fix time using the temporal activity sequence of the bug given as input. We will make use of the Mozilla Firefox BugZilla database for this purpose. We present an a comparison techniques using RNN, LSTM, GRU and CuDNNGRU and demonstrate the superior performance of using recurrent networks over HMM-based approach used in the existing literature.
